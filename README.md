# MerossApi

Welcome to **MerossApi** - your gateway to controlling Meross devices using a REST API built with Flask. 
This application seamlessly integrates the latest meross-iot library, providing you with the power to load and toggle your devices with multiple accounts simultaneously.

## Features

- **Multi-Account Control:** Effortlessly manage your Meross devices with multiple accounts concurrently.
- **Token-based Authentication:** Security is paramount. This application ensures authentication through tokens, keeping your devices and data safe.
- **JSON Output:** The application outputs data in JSON format, allowing you to implement a custom front-end for a personalized device management experience.

**Note:** This is my inaugural Python project, so your understanding and mercy are greatly appreciated! ðŸ˜Š 
I have plans to release a front-end, possibly using Vue or React, along with ongoing improvements to the back-end.

**Project Status:** Work in progress. Expect exciting updates and enhancements in the future!
