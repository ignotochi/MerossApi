# MerossApi

This application provide REST API using flask to control your meross devices,
this application integrates the lastes meross-iot library.

With this app yuo can Load and Toggle your devices.

the authentication is guaranteed by a token, and the output is a json, so you
can implement you front-end tho manage your devices.

This is my first project in python, so please have a mercy on me! =)

in the future i will release a front-end, maybe in Vue or React, 
and improvements for the back-end .

Remind this is a work in progress project.

Enjoy
